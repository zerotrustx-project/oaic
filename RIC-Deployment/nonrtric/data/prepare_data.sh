# This script is populating some data into nonrtric for demo/test purpose.
# First this script copies data/ folder into one of the rics, in below case a1-sim-osc-0.
# Then from the ric, run populate_policy_data.sh and populate_information_data.sh.
# populate_policy_data.sh creates policy-types, service, and policies.
# populate_information_data.sh creates EiProducer, EiType, and EiJob.
#
# Why we run the scripts in the ric, not from the host?
# Because a1-simulators(ric) are deployed in statefulset,
# they are not exposed to outside the k8s cluster.
# And we must create policy type into the ric first.
# Similarly, the informationservice is not exposed outside the k8s cluster,
# hence the commands for populating information data need to be run from within the cluster.

kubectl -n nonrtric cp run_in_k8s a1-sim-osc-0:/usr/src/app/
kubectl -n nonrtric exec -it a1-sim-osc-0 -- bash -c 'cd run_in_k8s/ && ./populate_policy_data.sh && ./populate_information_data.sh'
